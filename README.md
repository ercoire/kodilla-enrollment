This solo project has been submitted as graduation project for Kodilla bootcamp September 2023. My application manages enrollment for classes and workshops/events for a dance school.

Backend side is mostly based on Spring and Hibernate, with Lombok and Junit to support efficiency and testing. Local database is built using MySQL.

Frontend is set up using Vaadin library. It is available in [kodilla-enrollment-frontend](https://github.com/ercoire/kodilla-enrollment-frontend)https://github.com/ercoire/kodilla-enrollment-frontend

External API that has been used fetches data regarding dance levels for West Coast Swing dancers, that are stored in World Swing Dance Council (https://www.worldsdc.com/registry-points/). WCS is main dance style offered in Happy Steps :)
